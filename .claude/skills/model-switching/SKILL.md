# Model Switching

Guide for selecting the optimal Claude model based on task complexity, speed requirements, and cost considerations.

## Model Overview

### Claude Haiku (Fastest, Most Economical)
**Best for**: Simple, well-defined tasks with clear patterns
- ⚡ **Speed**: Fastest responses
- 💰 **Cost**: Most economical
- 🎯 **Strengths**: Following clear instructions, structured tasks, validation
- ⚠️ **Limitations**: Less capable with complex reasoning, ambiguous requirements

### Claude Sonnet (Balanced, Default)
**Best for**: Most general development work
- ⚡ **Speed**: Good balance
- 💰 **Cost**: Moderate
- 🎯 **Strengths**: General coding, debugging, testing, documentation
- ⚠️ **Limitations**: May struggle with highly complex architecture decisions

### Claude Opus (Most Capable, Slowest)
**Best for**: Complex, open-ended problems requiring deep reasoning
- ⚡ **Speed**: Slower but more thorough
- 💰 **Cost**: Highest
- 🎯 **Strengths**: Complex reasoning, architecture, ambiguous problems, novel solutions
- ⚠️ **Limitations**: Speed and cost

## When to Use Each Model

### Use Haiku For:

**Ralph Wiggum Validation Loops**
```markdown

- "Design an abstraction for managing complex state"

## How to Switch Models

### Model Selection Can't Be Automated Mid-Session

**Important**: Skills can't automatically switch models during a conversation. The model is set when you start the session.

**What you CAN do:**
1. **Start session with chosen model** using `/model` command
2. **Restart with different model** if task complexity changes
3. **Use this skill** to decide which model before starting

### Model Selection Decision Tree

```markdown
Starting a new task?
├─ Is it validation/testing/following checklist?
│  └─ Use Haiku (fast, economical)
│
├─ Is it standard development work?
│  └─ Use Sonnet (balanced, default)
│
└─ Is it complex/ambiguous/critical?
   └─ Use Opus (thorough, expensive)
```

### When to Switch Models

**Start with Sonnet** (default), then adjust:

**Switch to Haiku if:**
- Task becomes repetitive validation loops
- Clear validation checklist to follow
- Just need to verify/test
- Speed is more important than reasoning

**Switch to Opus if:**
- Sonnet is struggling with complexity
- Requirements are unclear
- Critical architecture decision needed
- Novel problem without precedent

## Model Selection by Work Type

- Batch operations
- Checking status frequently

Result: 3-5x faster responses
```

### For Complex Work (Prioritize Quality)

```markdown
Use Opus for:
- First-time complex implementation
- Critical bug investigation
- Architecture decisions
- Novel problems

Result: Higher accuracy, fewer iterations
```

### For Most Work (Balance)

```markdown
Use Sonnet for:
- General development
- Standard patterns
- Known workflows

Result: Good balance of speed and capability
```

## Ralph Wiggum Loop Model Strategy

**Optimal pattern for validation loops:**

```markdown
Phase 1: Implementation (Sonnet or Opus)
- Use Sonnet for standard features
- Use Opus for complex features
- Implement until ready for validation

Phase 2: Validation Loop (Haiku)
- Switch to Haiku for fast validation
- Run tests, checks, deployments
- Quick feedback on pass/fail
- Create bug beads for failures

Phase 3: Bug Fixes (Match complexity)
- Haiku: Simple fixes
- Sonnet: Standard fixes
- Opus: Complex root causes

Phase 4: Final Validation (Haiku)
- Fast final validation with Haiku
- Check all DoD criteria
- Close bead

Next Task:
- Choose model based on next task type
```

**Why this works:**
- Implementation uses appropriate intelligence
- Validation is fast and economical
- Bug fixes match their complexity
- Overall cost and time optimized

## Practical Examples

### Example 1: Feature Development

```markdown
Task: "Add user profile page with avatar upload"

Choose Sonnet:
- Standard feature (not novel)
- Clear requirements
- Known patterns (file upload, UI)
- Not critical architecture decision

Work session:
1. Start with Sonnet
2. Implement feature
3. When ready to validate, could switch to Haiku for fast validation loop
4. Haiku runs tests, checks deployment
5. If bugs found, stay Haiku for simple fixes, use Sonnet for complex fixes
```

### Example 2: Complex Architecture

```markdown
Task: "Design a plugin system for our app"

Choose Opus:
- Novel requirement
- Architectural decision
- No clear precedent
- Critical design choice

Work session:
1. Start with Opus
2. Opus designs architecture
3. Opus creates implementation plan
4. Switch to Sonnet for implementation
5. Switch to Haiku for validation
```

### Example 3: Validation Loop

```markdown
Task: "Validate feature meets DoD before closing bead"

Choose Haiku:
- Following clear checklist (DoD)
- Running predefined tests
- Checking deployment logs
- Fast iteration needed

Work session:
1. Start with Haiku
2. Run validation checks
3. Report results
4. If issues, create bug beads
5. Close bead when all checks pass
```

## Best Practices

### Do
- ✅ Start with Sonnet by default
- ✅ Use Haiku for validation loops
- ✅ Use Opus for complex/novel problems
- ✅ Consider speed vs quality tradeoff
- ✅ Switch models when task complexity changes
- ✅ Use Haiku for high-volume operations

### Don't
- ❌ Use Opus for simple validation
- ❌ Use Haiku for complex reasoning
- ❌ Stick with one model for all work
- ❌ Ignore cost when doing repetitive tasks
- ❌ Ignore speed when in validation loops

## Model Selection Checklist

**Before starting work, ask:**

```markdown
Task complexity?
├─ Simple/Clear → Haiku
├─ Standard/Moderate → Sonnet
└─ Complex/Novel → Opus

Speed priority?
├─ Fast iteration needed → Haiku
├─ Balanced → Sonnet
└─ Thoroughness over speed → Opus

Task type?
├─ Validation/Testing → Haiku
├─ Development/Debugging → Sonnet
└─ Architecture/Design → Opus

Cost sensitivity?
├─ High volume operations → Haiku
├─ Normal work → Sonnet
└─ Critical decisions → Opus (worth the cost)
```

## Quick Reference

**Default Choice**: Sonnet (works for 80% of tasks)

**Upgrade to Opus when:**
- Sonnet struggles
- Novel/complex problem
- Critical decision
- Worth the time/cost

**Downgrade to Haiku when:**
- Fast iteration needed
- Clear checklist to follow
- Validation loops
- High-volume operations

## Anti-Patterns

❌ Using Opus for simple validation (waste of time/money)
❌ Using Haiku for complex architecture (insufficient capability)
❌ Never switching models (one size doesn't fit all)
❌ Using Sonnet for repetitive validation (Haiku is faster)
❌ Starting with Opus by default (use when needed)

## Integration with Other Skills

### With validation-before-close
```markdown
Recommendation: Use Haiku
- Validation follows clear DoD checklist
- Fast iteration needed for loops
- Well-defined pass/fail criteria
```

### With auto-bug-tracking
```markdown
Recommendation: Match bug complexity
- Simple bug → Haiku can fix
- Standard bug → Sonnet
- Complex bug → Opus for root cause
```

### With reference-context
```markdown
Recommendation: Sonnet or Opus
- Need to understand documentation
- Requires reasoning about context
- Haiku sufficient only if just reading known docs
```

### With dod-criteria
```markdown
Recommendation: Haiku
- Following predefined checklists
- Clear criteria to verify
- Fast iteration
```

## Summary

**Choose your model wisely:**
- **Haiku**: Fast validation, clear tasks, high volume
- **Sonnet**: General development (default)
- **Opus**: Complex reasoning, architecture, critical decisions

**For ralph wiggum loops:**
- Implementation: Sonnet or Opus (based on complexity)
- Validation: Haiku (fast iteration)
