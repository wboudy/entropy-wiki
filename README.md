> [!NOTE]
> Entropy is the raw chaos of real systems. We capture it, compress it, and ship it as repeatable advantage.

## Mission
Build a cyber-utilitarian monorepo for AI skills, prompts, and MCP toolsets. High-signal, plug-and-play, and deployable via Nextra/Next.js.

## Architecture
- `docs/beads/`: Atomic logic snippets.
- `docs/skills-bank/`: Functional capabilities.
- `docs/prompt-bank/`: Categorized, high-performance prompts.
- `docs/tooling-mcp/`: MCP server configs, custom tool definitions, API bridge logic.
- `docs/orchestration/`: Multi-agent handoff protocols and state-management.
- `docs/context/`: MAP.md strategies, context pruning, token saving.
- `docs/lab/`: Learnings, failure logs, model-specific quirks.

> [!TIP]
> Keep entries short, dense, and operational. If a file can't be executed, it should at least be copy-pastable.

> [!CAUTION]
> Avoid fluff. Every line should either increase capability or reduce ambiguity.
