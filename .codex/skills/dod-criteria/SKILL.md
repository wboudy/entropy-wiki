# Definition of Done Criteria

Standard DoD checklists for different work types to ensure quality and completeness before closing beads.

## When to Use

Use this skill in conjunction with **validation-before-close** to:
- Determine what validation is required
- Know when ralph wiggum loops should end
- Ensure work meets quality standards
- Verify acceptance criteria are complete

## Core DoD (Always Required)

These apply to **all bead types**:

```markdown

- [ ] No type checking errors (if TypeScript/typed language)
- [ ] No console.log or debug statements left in code
- [ ] Code follows project style guide

✅ Version Control
- [ ] Changes committed with clear commit message
- [ ] No unintended files committed
- [ ] Git status is clean

✅ No Regressions
- [ ] Existing functionality still works
- [ ] No new errors introduced
```

## Ralph Wiggum Loop Integration

The DoD criteria define your **loop exit condition**:

```markdown
Loop Pattern:
1. Make change
2. Run validation checks (validation-before-close)
3. Check DoD criteria for work type
4. If any DoD item unchecked:
   a. Create bug bead if needed (auto-bug-tracking)
   b. Fix the issue
   c. Go back to step 2
5. If all DoD items checked:
   a. Update documentation (auto-documentation)
   b. Close bead
   c. Loop ends ✅
```

**Loop continues until ALL DoD criteria are met.**

## How to Use This Skill

### During Planning

When creating a bead, reference appropriate DoD:

```bash
bd create "Feature: Add user login" \
  --type=feature \
  --acceptance="See dod-criteria skill for feature DoD"
```

### During Validation

Before closing a bead:

1. Identify work type (bug, feature, task, etc.)
2. Reference DoD criteria for that type
3. Check off each item
4. Only close when all items checked

### With validation-before-close

The validation-before-close skill should reference this skill:

1. **validation-before-close** asks: "What validation is needed?"
2. **dod-criteria** answers: "Here's the checklist for this work type"
3. Work through checklist
4. Close when complete

## Customizing DoD

### Project-Specific DoD

Add to CodexDocs/dod.md:

```markdown
# Project-Specific DoD

In addition to standard DoD, this project requires:

- [ ] Storybook stories updated (for UI components)
- [ ] Performance budget met (< 3s page load)
- [ ] Analytics events tracked (for user actions)
- [ ] Internationalization keys added (for UI text)
```

### Bead-Specific DoD

Add to bead acceptance criteria:

```bash
bd update <bead-id> \
  --acceptance="Standard feature DoD +
  - Integration with payment provider tested
  - PCI compliance verified
  - Legal team approval received"
```

## Quick Reference

**Before closing ANY bead:**

1. ✅ Core DoD (always required)
2. ✅ Work type specific DoD
3. ✅ Context-specific DoD (deployment platform, tech stack)
4. ✅ Project-specific DoD (if any)
5. ✅ Bead-specific acceptance criteria

**If any item unchecked:** Don't close. Fix issues and re-validate.

**Loop ends when:** All items checked ✅

## Best Practices

### Be Honest About DoD

Don't check items you didn't actually do:
- ❌ "I'm pretty sure tests pass" → ✅ Actually run tests
- ❌ "Deployment probably worked" → ✅ Check deployment logs
- ❌ "Should be fine in production" → ✅ Actually test production

### Adjust DoD for Context

Not all DoD items apply to all beads:
- Hotfix bug? → Focus on fix verification, tests, deployment
- Internal refactor? → Focus on tests pass, no regressions
- Docs update? → Focus on accuracy, links, rendering

Use judgment, but err on the side of thoroughness.

### Document Skipped Items

If you intentionally skip a DoD item:

```bash
bd close <bead-id> --reason="Skipped E2E tests - test infrastructure broken, created follow-up bead: <bead-id>"
```

## Anti-Patterns

❌ Closing beads with failing tests
❌ Checking DoD items you didn't verify
❌ Skipping validation "because it's small"
❌ Assuming deployment worked without checking
❌ Closing before acceptance criteria met
❌ Ignoring DoD for "urgent" work (creates tech debt)

## Example: Complete DoD Check

**Bead**: "Feature: Add markdown rendering to wiki pages"
**Type**: Feature
