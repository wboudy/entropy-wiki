# Validation Before Close

Perform comprehensive validation before closing beads to ensure work is truly complete and meets acceptance criteria.

## When to Use

Activate **before closing any bead** to verify:
- Work is actually complete
- Tests pass
- Builds succeed
- Deployments work
- Acceptance criteria are met
- No regressions introduced

## Validation Levels

Choose validation level based on bead impact:

### Level 1: Code Validation
**For**: Internal refactoring, small changes
- Run linter
- Run type checker
- Verify no syntax errors

### Level 2: Test Validation
**For**: Bug fixes, feature changes
- Run relevant test suite
- Add tests if missing
- Verify tests pass

### Level 3: Build Validation
**For**: Dependencies, configuration changes
- Run build process
- Verify no build errors
- Check for warnings

### Level 4: Deployment Validation
**For**: User-facing changes, deployments
- Check deployment logs (Vercel, Railway, etc.)
- Verify deployment succeeded
- Test in deployed environment

### Level 5: Full Smoke Test
**For**: Critical features, breaking changes
- Manual testing of key flows
- Verify all acceptance criteria
- Check for regressions

## Workflow

### 1. Review Acceptance Criteria

Before closing, review what "done" means:
- Check bead description for acceptance criteria
- List what needs to be validated
- Identify appropriate validation level

### 2. Run Automated Validation

Execute appropriate automated checks:

```bash
# Code validation
npm run lint
npm run typecheck

# Test validation
npm test
# OR
pytest

# Build validation
npm run build
# OR
python setup.py build
```

### 3. Check Deployment (if applicable)

For deployed projects, verify deployment:

**Vercel:**
```bash
# Check deployment status
vercel ls

# View deployment logs
vercel logs <deployment-url>

# Test deployment
curl <deployment-url>
```

**Railway:**
```bash
# Check deployment logs
railway logs

# View deployment status
railway status
```

**General deployment check:**
- Visit deployed URL
- Verify page loads
- Check console for errors
- Test key functionality

### 4. Perform Smoke Testing

Manual checks for user-facing changes:

**Web Projects:**
- [ ] Page loads without errors
- [ ] No console errors or warnings
- [ ] Key user flows work
- [ ] Responsive design intact
- [ ] No visual regressions

**API Projects:**
- [ ] Endpoints respond correctly
- [ ] Error handling works
- [ ] Authentication still works
- [ ] Rate limiting functions
- [ ] Documentation updated

**CLI Tools:**
- [ ] Commands execute successfully
- [ ] Help text is accurate
- [ ] Error messages are clear
- [ ] Configuration works
- [ ] Examples in README work

### 5. Verify Acceptance Criteria

Go through each acceptance criterion:
- ✅ Does the implementation match?
- ✅ Are edge cases handled?
- ✅ Is it tested?
- ✅ Is it documented?

If any criterion is not met: **Do not close the bead**.

### 6. Close Bead Only After Validation

After all validation passes:

```bash
bd close <bead-id>
```

If validation fails:
- Create bug beads for failures
- Fix issues
- Re-validate
- Then close

## Integration with Ralph Wiggum Loops

Validation is the core of ralph wiggum loops:

```markdown
Loop iteration:
1. Make change
2. Validate (this skill)
3. If validation fails:
   a. Create bug bead
   b. Fix bug
   c. Go to step 2
4. If validation passes:
   a. Update documentation
   b. Close bead
   c. Move to next work
```

## Validation Checklist by Project Type

### Next.js / React Projects

```markdown
Before closing:
- [ ] `npm run lint` passes
- [ ] `npm run typecheck` passes (if TypeScript)
- [ ] `npm run build` succeeds
- [ ] `npm test` passes (if tests exist)
- [ ] Deployed to Vercel successfully
- [ ] Deployed site loads without errors
- [ ] No console errors in browser
- [ ] Page renders correctly
- [ ] Navigation works
- [ ] Responsive on mobile
```

### API / Backend Projects

```markdown
Before closing:
- [ ] Linter passes
- [ ] Type checks pass
- [ ] Unit tests pass
- [ ] Integration tests pass
- [ ] Build succeeds
- [ ] Deployed to Railway/hosting
- [ ] Health check endpoint responds
- [ ] API endpoints return correct responses
- [ ] Error handling works
- [ ] Authentication still works
```

### CLI / Tool Projects

```markdown
Before closing:
- [ ] Code compiles/builds
- [ ] Tests pass
- [ ] CLI commands execute
- [ ] Help text is accurate
- [ ] Examples work
- [ ] Installation instructions correct
- [ ] README updated
```

### Documentation / Content Changes

```markdown
Before closing:
- [ ] Markdown renders correctly
- [ ] Links work
- [ ] Code examples are accurate
- [ ] Images/diagrams display
- [ ] Spelling/grammar checked
- [ ] Consistent with existing style
```

## Deployment Log Checking

### Vercel Deployment Validation

```bash
# 1. Check recent deployments
vercel ls

# 2. Get logs for latest deployment
vercel logs <deployment-url>

# 3. Look for errors
# Common issues:
# - Build errors
# - Missing environment variables
# - Import errors
# - Type errors

# 4. Test deployed URL
curl -I <deployment-url>  # Check HTTP status
curl <deployment-url>      # Check content
```

### Railway Deployment Validation

```bash
# 1. Check deployment status
railway status

# 2. View logs
railway logs --tail 100

# 3. Look for:
# - "Build successful"
# - "Deployment successful"
# - No error messages
# - Server started successfully

# 4. Test deployment
curl <railway-url>
```

## Best Practices

### Validate Incrementally

Don't wait until the end to validate:
- Validate after each significant change
- Run tests frequently
- Check builds regularly
- Catch issues early

### Automate Where Possible

Use CI/CD and hooks:
- Pre-commit hooks for linting
- Pre-push hooks for tests
- GitHub Actions for builds
- Automated deployment checks

### Keep Validation Fast

Optimize validation time:
- Run relevant tests, not full suite every time
- Use watch mode during development
- Cache build artifacts
- Parallelize where possible

### Document Validation Steps

In bead acceptance criteria, include:
- What tests to run
- What to check manually
- How to verify deployment
- Expected outcomes

## Anti-Patterns

❌ Closing beads without running tests
❌ Assuming "it works on my machine" means it's done
❌ Skipping deployment verification
❌ Closing beads with failing tests
❌ Ignoring build warnings
❌ Not testing in deployed environment
❌ Closing before acceptance criteria are met

## Emergency Override

In rare cases, you may need to close without full validation:

**When to override:**
- Urgent hotfix needed
- Validation infrastructure is broken
- Blocking other critical work

**How to override safely:**
1. Document what validation was skipped
2. Create follow-up bead for full validation
3. Add `--reason` to close command
4. Notify team of incomplete validation

```bash
bd close <bead-id> --reason="Urgent deploy, full validation pending in <new-bead-id>"
```

## Validation Troubleshooting

### Tests Fail

1. Run tests locally
2. Check for environment differences
3. Review test output for specifics
4. Fix failing tests
5. Re-run validation

### Build Fails

1. Check build logs for errors
2. Verify dependencies are installed
3. Check for TypeScript/lint errors
4. Fix issues
5. Re-run build

### Deployment Fails

1. Check deployment logs
2. Verify environment variables
3. Check for missing dependencies
4. Test build locally
5. Re-deploy after fixes

## Example: Complete Validation Flow

**Scenario**: Closing bead for "Add markdown rendering to wiki pages"

**Validation process:**

```bash
# 1. Code validation
npm run lint          # ✅ Passes
npm run typecheck     # ✅ Passes

# 2. Build validation
npm run build         # ✅ Succeeds

# 3. Test validation
npm test              # ✅ All tests pass

# 4. Deploy to staging
git push              # Triggers Vercel deploy

# 5. Check Vercel logs
vercel logs           # ✅ No errors

# 6. Smoke test deployed site
# Visit https://deployed-url.vercel.app
# - Open wiki page ✅
# - Markdown renders ✅
# - No console errors ✅
# - Navigation works ✅
# - Mobile responsive ✅

# 7. Verify acceptance criteria
# ✅ Markdown files render as HTML
# ✅ GitHub-flavored markdown supported
# ✅ Code blocks have syntax highlighting
# ✅ Links work correctly

# 8. All validation passed - close bead
bd close entropy-wiki-xyz
```

**Result**: Bead closed with confidence that work is complete and working.
