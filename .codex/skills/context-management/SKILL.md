# Context Management

Optimize context usage and efficiency during ralph wiggum validation loops to prevent context overflow and speed up iterations.

## When to Use

Activate during:
- **Long ralph wiggum loops** - Multiple validation iterations
- **Complex tasks** - Large files, many dependencies
- **Context warnings** - When approaching context limits
- **Slow responses** - Performance degradation from full context
- **Multi-step workflows** - Many tool calls needed

## Context Awareness

### Monitor Context Usage

Watch for these signs of high context usage:
- 🟡 **75-85% full**: Consider compaction soon
- 🔴 **85-95% full**: Compact before continuing
- 🚨 **95%+ full**: Compact immediately or risk truncation

**Context is filling when:**
- Reading many large files
- Multiple validation loops completed
- Long conversation history
- Many skills loaded
- Large tool outputs

### When to Compact

**Compact immediately if:**
- About to start new major task
- Finished validation loop and moving to next bead
- Context > 85% and need to read more files
- Starting a new ralph loop iteration
- Performance noticeably degraded

**Good times to compact:**
- ✅ After closing a bead (preserve outcome, discard details)
- ✅ Between major task phases
- ✅ After validation loops complete
- ✅ Before reading large documentation
- ✅ After fixing a bug (keep the fix, discard debugging)

**Bad times to compact:**
- ❌ In the middle of implementation
- ❌ During active debugging
- ❌ While validation is failing
- ❌ When you need recent conversation context

### How to Compact Effectively

When you need to compact during a session:

**Step 1: Finish current micro-task**
```markdown
Complete the immediate action:
- Finish the current file edit
- Complete the validation check
- Close the bug you're fixing
```

**Step 2: Document current state**
```markdown
Before compacting, note:
- Current bead ID and status
- What you just completed
- What's next to do
- Any blockers or open issues
```

**Step 3: Suggest compaction to user**
```markdown
"Context is at ~85%. Good time to compact:
- Just closed entropy-wiki-xyz
- Ready to start next bead
- Can preserve: outcomes, decisions, open beads
- Can discard: debugging details, validation logs

Suggest running: /compact"
```

**Step 4: After compaction, use beads to recover context**
```bash
# Check what's in progress
bd list --status=in_progress

# Review current bead
bd show <bead-id>

# Continue work
```

## Ralph Loop Optimization

### Efficient Loop Pattern

```markdown
Optimized Ralph Wiggum Loop:

1. **Setup** (do once):
   - Load relevant references (reference-context)
   - Check DoD criteria for work type
   - Prepare validation commands

2. **Iterate** (repeat until DoD met):
   - Make focused change
   - Validate immediately
   - Fix failures → back to validate
   - Avoid re-reading same files

3. **Complete** (do once):
   - Final validation
   - Update docs
   - Close bead
   - Compact context

4. **Next** (move to next work):
   - Context is fresh
   - Start new loop
```

### Batch Operations

**Instead of sequential tool calls:**
❌ Bad:
```markdown
1. Read file A
2. Wait for response
3. Read file B
4. Wait for response
5. Read file C
```

✅ Good:
```markdown
1. Read A, B, C in parallel (single message, multiple tool calls)
2. Process all results together
```

**Example: Parallel validation checks**
```bash
# Run these in parallel
npm run lint & npm run typecheck & npm test
```

### Progressive Disclosure

**Load context incrementally:**

❌ Bad:
```markdown
1. Read entire ClaudeDocs directory
2. Read all components
3. Read all tests
4. Then start work
```

✅ Good:
```markdown
1. Read only what you need now
2. Make change
3. If need more context, load specific file
4. Continue
```

### Tool Efficiency

Choose the most efficient tool:

**For finding files:**
- ✅ Use `Glob` for pattern matching
- ❌ Don't use `Bash ls` and `grep`

**For searching content:**
- ✅ Use `Grep` with specific patterns
- ❌ Don't read every file to search

**For reading files:**
- ✅ Use `Read` with offset/limit for large files
- ❌ Don't read entire file if you need one section

**For executing commands:**
- ✅ Batch with `&&` for dependent operations
- ✅ Parallel with multiple Bash calls for independent operations
- ❌ Don't run one at a time if they can be parallel

## Context-Saving Strategies

### 1. Reference, Don't Inline

❌ Bad (wastes context):
```markdown
I found these issues:
[paste 200 lines of errors]
```

✅ Good:
```markdown
Found 5 type errors in src/components/
- WikiPage.tsx:42 - missing 'content' prop
- [summary of other 4 errors]
```

### 2. Summarize Outputs

❌ Bad:
```markdown
Test output: [paste 500 lines]
```

✅ Good:
```markdown
Tests: 15/15 passing
- Unit tests: ✅ (8 tests)
- Integration tests: ✅ (7 tests)
```

### 3. Use Beads as Memory

❌ Bad:
```markdown
Keep entire debugging session in context
```

✅ Good:
```markdown
Create bug bead with:
- Error message
- Root cause
- Solution
Discard the debugging conversation
```

### 4. Clean Up After Validation

❌ Bad:
```markdown
Keep all validation output in context
```

✅ Good:
```markdown
Validation passed ✅
[Discard 100 lines of logs, keep summary]
```

## Context Budget Guidelines

### Allocate Context Wisely

**Reserve context for:**
- 🎯 **Active work** (30-40%): Current files being edited
- 📚 **References** (20-30%): Loaded skills, docs as needed
- 💬 **Conversation** (20-30%): Recent decisions, context
- 🔧 **Tool outputs** (10-20%): Validation results, errors

**When context is tight:**
1. Prioritize active work files
2. Load references on-demand only
3. Summarize tool outputs aggressively
4. Compact conversation history

### Context-Heavy Operations

These consume lots of context:
- Reading multiple large files
- Loading all skills at once
- Keeping long error logs
- Multiple validation iterations without cleanup

**Mitigation:**
- Read files selectively
- Load skills progressively
- Summarize errors
- Compact between loops

## Efficiency Patterns

### Pattern 1: Fast Iteration Loop

```markdown
For quick validation cycles:

1. Make minimal change
2. Run fast validation (lint, typecheck)
3. If fails: fix immediately, don't investigate deeply
4. If passes: continue
5. Save deep validation for end

This keeps loops fast and context lean.
```

### Pattern 2: Checkpoint and Compact

```markdown
For long tasks:

Every 3-5 beads closed:
1. Document progress
2. Compact context
3. Resume with fresh context
4. Use beads to recover state

This prevents context overflow.
```

### Pattern 3: Parallel Exploration

```markdown
When exploring codebase:

Instead of reading files one by one:
1. Glob for all relevant files
2. Grep for specific patterns
3. Read only the most relevant files
4. Load others if needed

This minimizes context usage.
```

## Integration with Other Skills

### With validation-before-close
```markdown
1. Before validation, check context usage
2. If > 80%, suggest compacting after validation
3. Run validation
4. If passes, compact before closing bead
5. Close bead with fresh context
```

### With auto-bug-tracking
```markdown
1. Create bug bead with essential info
2. Don't keep full debugging session in context
3. Bug bead serves as memory
4. Can compact after bug is created
```

### With reference-context
```markdown
1. Load references progressively
2. Don't load all docs upfront
3. Read specific sections only
4. Unload after use (happens automatically on compact)
```

## Compaction Checklist

**Before suggesting compaction to user:**

```markdown
Ready to compact if:
- [ ] Current micro-task is complete
- [ ] No validation in progress
- [ ] Context > 85% OR just closed a bead
- [ ] Important info documented (in beads, commits, or notes)
- [ ] Next action is clear

Suggest: "Context at ~XX%. Good time to compact. Run: /compact"
```

**What to preserve during compaction:**
- Open bead IDs and status
- Recent decisions and outcomes
- Active blockers or issues
- Next actions

**What can be discarded:**
- Detailed debugging logs
- Validation output details
- Historical conversation (if captured in beads)
- Tool outputs (if action taken based on them)

## Best Practices

### Do
- ✅ Monitor context throughout work
- ✅ Batch tool calls when possible
- ✅ Use progressive disclosure
- ✅ Summarize outputs aggressively
- ✅ Compact between major phases
- ✅ Use beads as persistent memory
- ✅ Suggest compaction proactively

### Don't
- ❌ Keep unnecessary details in context
- ❌ Re-read same files multiple times
- ❌ Load all references upfront
- ❌ Keep full validation logs
- ❌ Wait until context is 100% full
- ❌ Compact during active work
- ❌ Forget to document before compacting

## Quick Reference

**Context Warning Levels:**
```markdown
🟢 < 75%: Normal operation
🟡 75-85%: Monitor closely
🔴 85-95%: Compact soon
🚨 95%+: Compact now
```

**Fast Compaction Decision Tree:**
```markdown
Context > 85%?
├─ No → Continue work
└─ Yes → Task complete?
    ├─ No → Finish micro-task first
    └─ Yes → Suggest: /compact
```

**Efficiency Checklist:**
```markdown
For each operation ask:
- Can I batch this? (parallel tool calls)
- Do I need the full output? (summarize)
- Have I read this already? (avoid re-reading)
- Can I use a faster tool? (Grep vs Read all files)
```

## Anti-Patterns

❌ Keeping entire conversation when beads capture the state
❌ Reading documentation files multiple times
❌ Running validation checks sequentially when they can be parallel
❌ Waiting until context is completely full
❌ Not using beads for persistent memory
❌ Loading all skills at once (they load progressively)
❌ Keeping detailed logs after validation passes
❌ Compacting in the middle of debugging

## Example: Efficient Ralph Loop

**Scenario**: Feature implementation with multiple validation cycles

```markdown
Iteration 1:
- Context: 40%
- Make change
- Validate (lint, typecheck, test in parallel)
- 2 test failures found
- Create bug beads
- Context: 55%

Iteration 2:
- Fix bug 1
- Validate (only affected tests)
- Passes ✅
- Close bug bead
- Context: 60%

Iteration 3:
- Fix bug 2
- Validate (only affected tests)
- Passes ✅
- Close bug bead
- Context: 68%

Final Validation:
- Run full validation suite
- All checks pass ✅
- Context: 75%

Documentation:
- Update README
- Context: 78%

Close & Compact:
- Close feature bead
- Suggest: "Context at 78%, good time to compact before next task"
- User runs: /compact
- Context: 20% (fresh start)

Next Task:
- Start with lean context
- Fast iterations
```

**Result**: Efficient loop with proactive compaction prevents context overflow.
