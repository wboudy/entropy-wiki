# Orchestration

Multi-agent coordination patterns and handoff protocols.

## What is Orchestration?

Orchestration defines how multiple AI agents work together to solve complex problems. It covers task distribution, state management, and agent-to-agent communication.

## Core Concepts

Key orchestration patterns include:
- Sequential workflows (agent chains)
- Parallel execution (concurrent tasks)
- Hierarchical coordination (supervisor/worker)
- Event-driven handoffs

## Protocols

This section documents:
- Handoff protocols between agents
- State synchronization patterns
- Error handling and recovery
- Performance optimization strategies

Use these patterns to build robust multi-agent systems that coordinate effectively and handle failures gracefully.
