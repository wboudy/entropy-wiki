## Key Concepts (from source description)

### Gas Town Orchestration Framework
Blueprints for industrializing code production using multi-agent coordination patterns.

### MEOW Stack
**M**olecules, **E**?, **O**?, **W**isps - The core components of the Gas Town architecture:
- **Molecules**: Higher-order work units
- **Wisps**: Lightweight execution units
- (Full definitions require direct article access)

### Role-Based Agent Topology

**The Mayor**: Central coordinating agent
- Orchestrates overall workflow
- Assigns work to subordinate agents
- Maintains global context

**Polecats**: Worker agents
- Execute assigned tasks in parallel
- Report back to Mayor
- Can work independently on isolated subtasks

**The Refinery**: Processing agent
- Handles refinement and quality checks
- Validates outputs from Polecats
- Ensures consistency

### "Idea Compilation"
The process of taking high-level ideas and "compiling" them through the agent topology into working code - analogous to how compilers turn source code into executables.

## Technical Value for Agents

Gas Town provides patterns for:
1. **Multi-agent coordination** - How to orchestrate swarms
2. **Role separation** - Different agents with different responsibilities
3. **Parallel execution** - Polecats work simultaneously
4. **Quality gates** - Refinery ensures output quality
5. **Industrialization** - Moving from one-off agents to production systems
